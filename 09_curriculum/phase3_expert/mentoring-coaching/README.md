Mentoring & Coaching involves guiding, developing, and empowering individuals and teams to achieve their full potential through structured relationships, skill development, and performance improvement.

## Mentoring Frameworks

### 1. GROW Model

#### GROW Coaching Framework

## Follow-up Questions

### 1. Mentoring Frameworks
**Q: What's the difference between mentoring and coaching?**
A: Mentoring is a long-term relationship focused on career development and guidance, while coaching is typically shorter-term and focused on specific skills or performance improvement.

### 2. Coaching Models
**Q: When should you use solution-focused vs. cognitive behavioral coaching?**
A: Use solution-focused coaching for goal-oriented individuals who want to move forward, and CBT coaching for those struggling with limiting beliefs or negative thought patterns.

### 3. Skill Development
**Q: How do you create effective skill development plans?**
A: Assess current competencies, set clear goals, identify learning resources, create practice opportunities, and establish regular feedback mechanisms.
