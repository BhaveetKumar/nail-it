## 🧮 **Algorithm Questions**

### **Question 5: Implement LRU Cache**

**Question**: Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with O(1) operations.

**Approach**:
1. **Data Structures**
   - Hash map for O(1) lookup
   - Doubly linked list for O(1) insertion/deletion

2. **Operations**
   - Get: Move to head if exists
   - Put: Add to head, remove tail if full

3. **Implementation**
   - Node structure for linked list
   - Head and tail pointers
   - Size tracking

**Answer**:
```go
type Node struct {
    key   int
    value int
    prev  *Node
    next  *Node
}

type LRUCache struct {
    capacity int
    cache    map[int]*Node
    head     *Node
    tail     *Node
}

func Constructor(capacity int) LRUCache {
    head := &Node{}
    tail := &Node{}
    head.next = tail
    tail.prev = head
    
    return LRUCache{
        capacity: capacity,
        cache:    make(map[int]*Node),
        head:     head,
        tail:     tail,
    }
}

func (lru *LRUCache) Get(key int) int {
    if node, exists := lru.cache[key]; exists {
        lru.moveToHead(node)
        return node.value
    }
    return -1
}

func (lru *LRUCache) Put(key int, value int) {
    if node, exists := lru.cache[key]; exists {
        node.value = value
        lru.moveToHead(node)
        return
    }
    
    if len(lru.cache) >= lru.capacity {
        lru.removeTail()
    }
    
    newNode := &Node{key: key, value: value}
    lru.cache[key] = newNode
    lru.addToHead(newNode)
}

func (lru *LRUCache) moveToHead(node *Node) {
    lru.removeNode(node)
    lru.addToHead(node)
}

func (lru *LRUCache) addToHead(node *Node) {
    node.prev = lru.head
    node.next = lru.head.next
    lru.head.next.prev = node
    lru.head.next = node
}

func (lru *LRUCache) removeNode(node *Node) {
    node.prev.next = node.next
    node.next.prev = node.prev
}

func (lru *LRUCache) removeTail() {
    lastNode := lru.tail.prev
    lru.removeNode(lastNode)
    delete(lru.cache, lastNode.key)
}
```

### **Question 6: Find Maximum Subarray Sum**

**Question**: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray with maximum sum (Kadane's Algorithm).

**Approach**:
1. **Brute Force**: O(n³) - check all subarrays
2. **Optimized**: O(n) - Kadane's algorithm
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Track current and global maximum

**Answer**:
```go
func maxSubArray(nums []int) int {
    if len(nums) == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    
    maxSoFar := nums[0]
    maxEndingHere := nums[0]
    
    for i := 1; i < len(nums); i++ {
        maxEndingHere = max(nums[i], maxEndingHere+nums[i])
        maxSoFar = max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere)
    }
    
    return maxSoFar
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

## 👥 **Behavioral Questions**

### **Question 7: Leadership Scenario**

**Question**: Tell me about a time when you had to lead a team through a difficult technical challenge.

**STAR Method**:
- **Situation**: Describe the context
- **Task**: Explain your responsibility
- **Action**: Detail what you did
- **Result**: Share the outcome

**Answer**:
```
Situation: Our payment processing system was experiencing 2% failure rate during peak hours, causing revenue loss and customer complaints.

Task: As the tech lead, I needed to identify the root cause and implement a solution within 2 weeks.

Action: 
1. Conducted a thorough investigation using monitoring tools
2. Identified database connection pool exhaustion as the root cause
3. Implemented connection pooling optimization and circuit breaker pattern
4. Coordinated with the team to deploy the fix during low-traffic hours
5. Set up additional monitoring to prevent future issues

Result: Reduced failure rate to 0.1%, improved system reliability, and increased team confidence in handling similar challenges.
```

### **Question 8: Conflict Resolution**

**Approach**:
1. **Listen to both sides**
2. **Identify common ground**
3. **Evaluate technical merits**
4. **Make data-driven decision**
5. **Communicate decision clearly**

**Answer**:
```
I would approach this systematically:

1. Schedule a meeting with both engineers to understand their perspectives
2. Ask them to present their approaches with pros/cons and supporting data
3. Identify common goals and constraints
4. Evaluate each approach against our requirements (performance, maintainability, timeline)
5. If needed, create a proof-of-concept for both approaches
6. Make a data-driven decision based on technical merit
7. Communicate the decision with clear rationale
8. Ensure both engineers feel heard and valued
9. Follow up to ensure smooth implementation

The key is to focus on the problem, not personal preferences, and make decisions based on what's best for the product and team.
```

## 🔍 **Technical Deep Dive Questions**

### **Question 9: Go Concurrency**

**Question**: Explain how Go's goroutines work and how you would implement a worker pool pattern.

**Answer**:
```
Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They use a M:N threading model where M goroutines are multiplexed onto N OS threads.

Key features:
- Stack starts small (2KB) and grows as needed
- Managed by Go scheduler
- Communicate via channels
- Very cheap to create (thousands vs hundreds of OS threads)

Worker Pool Implementation:
```go
func workerPool(jobs <-chan Job, results chan<- Result, numWorkers int) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    
    for i := 0; i < numWorkers; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            for job := range jobs {
                result := processJob(job)
                results <- result
            }
        }()
    }
    
    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        close(results)
    }()
}
```

### **Question 10: Database Optimization**

**Question**: How would you optimize a slow database query that's taking 5 seconds to execute?

**Answer**:
```
1. Analyze the query execution plan using EXPLAIN ANALYZE
2. Identify bottlenecks (full table scans, missing indexes, etc.)
3. Add appropriate indexes for WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses
4. Consider query rewriting to use more efficient patterns
5. Check if the query can be broken into smaller parts
6. Evaluate if denormalization would help
7. Consider caching frequently accessed data
8. Look at database configuration (buffer pool, connection limits)
9. Monitor and measure improvements

Example:
```sql
-- Before: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 123 AND status = 'completed';

-- After: Add composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_status ON orders(user_id, status);
```

## 📊 **Case Study Questions**

### **Question 11: System Scaling**

**Question**: Your payment system is handling 10,000 requests per second but needs to scale to 100,000 requests per second. How would you approach this?

**Answer**:
```
1. Identify bottlenecks through profiling and monitoring
2. Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers
3. Optimize database with read replicas and sharding
4. Add caching layers (Redis, CDN)
5. Implement async processing with message queues
6. Use microservices architecture for independent scaling
7. Implement circuit breakers and rate limiting
8. Add monitoring and alerting for the scaled system
9. Plan for gradual rollout and rollback strategy
10. Test thoroughly under load before production deployment

Key metrics to monitor:

```

### **Question 12: Data Consistency**

**Question**: How would you ensure data consistency in a distributed payment system?

**Answer**:
```
1. Use distributed transactions (2PC, Saga pattern)
2. Implement eventual consistency with compensation
3. Use idempotency keys for duplicate prevention
4. Implement conflict resolution strategies
5. Use event sourcing for audit trail
6. Implement proper error handling and retry logic
7. Use database constraints and validation
8. Implement monitoring for consistency violations
9. Use message queues for reliable delivery
10. Plan for data reconciliation processes

Example Saga pattern:
1. Reserve payment amount
2. Process payment with external service
3. Update account balance
4. If any step fails, compensate previous steps
```
