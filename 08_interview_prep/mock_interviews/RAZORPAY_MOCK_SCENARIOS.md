## ðŸš€ **Mock Interview Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Senior Backend Engineer**

#### **Round 1: Coding Problems**

**Problem 1: Payment Transaction Validation (Medium)**
```
Given a list of payment transactions, implement a function to validate them:

1. Each transaction has: id, amount, user_id, timestamp, status
2. Validate that:
   - Amount is positive
   - User exists in the system
   - Transaction is not duplicate
   - Timestamp is not in the future
3. Return list of invalid transactions

Time: 20 minutes
Follow-up: Optimize for large datasets
```

**Problem 2: Rate Limiter Implementation (Hard)**
```
Implement a sliding window rate limiter:

1. Allow N requests per time window
2. Support multiple users
3. Handle concurrent requests
4. Use Go channels and goroutines

Time: 25 minutes
Follow-up: How would you make it distributed?
```

#### **Round 2: System Design**

**Design a Payment Gateway for 1M TPS**

**Requirements:**
- Handle 1M transactions per second
- Support multiple payment methods (UPI, cards, net banking)
- 99.99% availability
- <100ms response time
- Fraud detection
- Real-time settlement

**Discussion Points:**
- How would you handle peak traffic during festivals?
- What if UPI is down?
- How would you ensure data consistency?
- How would you scale the fraud detection system?

#### **Round 3: Technical Deep Dive**

**Go Runtime Questions:**
1. How does Go's garbage collector work?
2. How would you optimize memory usage in a high-throughput payment system?
3. Explain the difference between channels and mutexes
4. How would you handle a memory leak in production?

**System Architecture:**
1. How would you migrate from a monolith to microservices?
2. What's your approach to handling database migrations?
3. How would you implement circuit breakers in Go?
4. Describe your approach to monitoring and alerting

#### **Round 4: Behavioral**

**Questions:**
1. Tell me about a time you led a complex technical project
2. How do you handle conflicts in your team?
3. Describe a situation where you had to make a difficult technical decision
4. What's your biggest technical failure and what did you learn?

### **Scenario 2: Staff Backend Engineer**

#### **Round 1: Coding Problems**

**Problem 1: Distributed Cache Implementation (Hard)**
```
Implement a distributed cache with the following features:

1. Consistent hashing for sharding
2. Replication for fault tolerance
3. Cache eviction (LRU)
4. Health checks for nodes
5. Handle node failures gracefully

Time: 30 minutes
Follow-up: How would you handle split-brain scenarios?
```

**Problem 2: Event Sourcing System (Hard)**
```
Implement an event sourcing system for payment events:

1. Store events in append-only log
2. Replay events to rebuild state
3. Handle concurrent writes
4. Support event versioning
5. Implement snapshots for performance

Time: 30 minutes
Follow-up: How would you handle event ordering?
```

#### **Round 2: System Design**

**Design a Real-Time Fraud Detection System**

**Requirements:**
- Process 100K transactions per second
- Detect fraud in <50ms
- Support multiple fraud detection rules
- Handle rule updates without downtime
- Provide real-time risk scores
- Support A/B testing of rules

**Discussion Points:**
- How would you handle false positives?
- What if the ML model is down?
- How would you ensure rule consistency across shards?
- How would you handle rule conflicts?

#### **Round 3: Technical Deep Dive**

**Advanced Go Questions:**
1. How would you implement a lock-free data structure in Go?
2. Explain Go's memory model and its implications
3. How would you profile and optimize a Go application?
4. What are the trade-offs between different concurrency patterns?

**System Architecture:**
1. How would you design a multi-tenant system?
