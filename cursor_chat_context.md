# 📌 Cursor Chat Context - Repository Enrichment

## 🎯 **Current Session Progress**

### **Session Started**: Repository Reorganization and Enrichment

- **Goal**: Reorganize existing content into structured folders and enrich with comprehensive theory, diagrams, and implementations
- **Template**: Standardized .md file structure with theory, diagrams, examples, implementations (Golang + Node.js), complexity analysis, and follow-up questions

### **Folder Structure Created**:

```
system_design/patterns/
dsa/arrays/ dsa/graphs/ dsa/dp/ dsa/trees/ dsa/strings/ dsa/heap/ dsa/backtracking/ dsa/bit_manipulation/ dsa/sliding_window/ dsa/two_pointers/ dsa/sorting/ dsa/searching/ dsa/stack_queue/ dsa/linked_lists/ dsa/math/ dsa/greedy/
