# Lesson 23: Serde Advanced â€” Custom (De)Serializers and Enums

This lesson explores advanced Serde features: tagged enums and custom (de)serializers, using base64 encoding for binary data in JSON.

## Key Concepts

- Adjacently tagged enums via `#[serde(tag = "type", content = "data")]`.
- Field-level custom (de)serializers with `#[serde(with = "module")]`.
- Ensuring JSON-friendly representations (e.g., base64 for binary).

## Example

The example crate `examples/lesson23_serde_advanced` includes:

- `Message` enum with `Text` and `Binary(Vec<u8>)`; `Binary` uses `#[serde(with = "b64")]`.
- `b64` module providing `serialize`/`deserialize` with `base64` crate.
- Tests: round-trip for both variants, and JSON tagging assertions.

## Run the tests

- `cargo test -p lesson23_serde_advanced`
