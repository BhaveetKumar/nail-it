# Algorithms & Data Structures Library (Skeleton)

Implement classic DS & algorithms with safe paths and optional unsafe optimizations (feature-gated), plus criterion benchmarks.

Milestones:

- Core structures: vector, list, stack, queue, deque, heap.
- Trees: BST, AVL, Red-Black.
- Graphs: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*.
- Sorting & searching.
- Benchmarks with Criterion.
