# 90-Day Curriculum Overview

Phased progression engineered for transformation from mid-level backend to credible SDE3 / Tech Lead / EM candidate.

## Phases
1. **Weeks 1–2: Foundation** – Node.js internals, Go onboarding, core CS refresh.
2. **Weeks 3–6: Backend Core + System Design Fundamentals** – API surfaces, consistency, core patterns.
3. **Weeks 7–10: Projects + Performance & Resilience** – Build & benchmark 2 anchor projects.
4. **Weeks 11–12: Interview Execution** – High-intensity mock rotations + behavioral refinement.
5. **Week 13: Offer Strategy** – Negotiation preparation + compensation benchmarking.

## Cadence Principles
- Daily architecture articulation (5–10 min recap of prior learning).
- Weekly deliverable (design doc, benchmark, test coverage artifact).
- Continuous journaling of trade-offs.

## Success Criteria
- 4 polished design docs.
- 2 services deployed locally with performance + resilience reports.
- Story bank of 10 leadership/impact narratives.
- Mock system design scores consistently “strong hire”.
