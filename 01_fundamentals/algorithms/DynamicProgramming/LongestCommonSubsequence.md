# Longest Common Subsequence

### Problem
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

**Example:**
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

### Golang Solution

```go
func longestCommonSubsequence(text1 string, text2 string) int {
    m, n := len(text1), len(text2)
    dp := make([][]int, m+1)
    for i := range dp {
        dp[i] = make([]int, n+1)
    }
    
    for i := 1; i <= m; i++ {
        for j := 1; j <= n; j++ {
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1] {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n]
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

### Alternative Solutions

#### **Space Optimized**
```go
func longestCommonSubsequenceOptimized(text1 string, text2 string) int {
    if len(text1) < len(text2) {
        text1, text2 = text2, text1
    }
    
    m, n := len(text1), len(text2)
    prev := make([]int, n+1)
    curr := make([]int, n+1)
    
    for i := 1; i <= m; i++ {
        for j := 1; j <= n; j++ {
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1] {
                curr[j] = prev[j-1] + 1
            } else {
                curr[j] = max(prev[j], curr[j-1])
            }
        }
        prev, curr = curr, prev
    }
    
    return prev[n]
}
```

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(m × n) for DP, O(min(m, n)) for optimized
