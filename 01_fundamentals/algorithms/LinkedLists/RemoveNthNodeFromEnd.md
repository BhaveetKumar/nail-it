# Remove Nth Node From End of List

### Problem
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

### Golang Solution

```go
func removeNthFromEnd(head *ListNode, n int) *ListNode {
    dummy := &ListNode{Next: head}
    first := dummy
    second := dummy
    
    // Move first pointer n+1 steps ahead
    for i := 0; i <= n; i++ {
        first = first.Next
    }
    
    // Move both pointers until first reaches end
    for first != nil {
        first = first.Next
        second = second.Next
    }
    
    // Remove the nth node
    second.Next = second.Next.Next
    
    return dummy.Next
}
```

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
