# 01 Backend Core

Core service-building competencies: API design, data integrity, state, caching, asynchronous messaging.

## Areas

- `http_api_design/` – Resource modeling, pagination, versioning, error semantics.
- `api_security/` – AuthN/Z models (JWT, OAuth2, RBAC, ABAC), threat surfaces.
- `data_modeling/` – Relational vs NoSQL decision guides, normalization vs denormalization.
- `transactions_and_consistency/` – Isolation levels, distributed transaction patterns, idempotency.
- `caching_and_sessions/` – Layered caching, TTL strategy, session stores.
- `async_messaging_basics/` – Queues vs streams, delivery guarantees, backpressure.

## Outcome (Week 6)

Credible senior design decisions for service surfaces, correctness guarantees, and latency-aware data access paths.
