# Design Patterns for Backend Systems

This directory contains comprehensive design patterns commonly used in backend systems, with a focus on Go implementations and fintech/payment system use cases.

## Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns
- [Singleton](Singleton.md) - Ensure single instance with global access
- [Factory](Factory.md) - Create objects without specifying exact classes
- [Builder](Builder.md) - Construct complex objects step by step
- [Prototype](Prototype.md) - Clone objects for performance
- [Abstract Factory](AbstractFactory.md) - Create families of related objects

### Structural Patterns
- [Adapter](Adapter.md) - Make incompatible interfaces work together
- [Bridge](Bridge.md) - Separate abstraction from implementation
- [Composite](Composite.md) - Compose objects into tree structures
- [Decorator](Decorator.md) - Add behavior to objects dynamically
- [Facade](Facade.md) - Provide simplified interface to complex subsystem
- [Flyweight](Flyweight.md) - Share common state among many objects
- [Proxy](Proxy.md) - Provide placeholder for another object

### Behavioral Patterns
- [Observer](Observer.md) - Define one-to-many dependency between objects
- [Strategy](Strategy.md) - Define family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- [Command](Command.md) - Encapsulate requests as objects
- [State](State.md) - Allow object to alter behavior when internal state changes
- [Template Method](TemplateMethod.md) - Define skeleton of algorithm in base class
- [Chain of Responsibility](ChainOfResponsibility.md) - Pass requests along chain of handlers
- [Iterator](Iterator.md) - Provide way to access elements of aggregate object
- [Mediator](Mediator.md) - Define how objects interact with each other
- [Memento](Memento.md) - Capture and restore object's internal state
- [Visitor](Visitor.md) - Define new operations without changing classes

### Backend-Specific Patterns
- [Repository](Repository.md) - Abstract data access layer
- [Unit of Work](UnitOfWork.md) - Maintain list of objects affected by business transaction
- [Event Sourcing](EventSourcing.md) - Store events instead of current state
- [CQRS](CQRS.md) - Separate read and write operations
- [Saga](Saga.md) - Manage distributed transactions
- [Circuit Breaker](CircuitBreaker.md) - Prevent cascading failures

## Pattern Selection Guide

### For Data Access
- **Repository**: When you need to abstract data access
- **Unit of Work**: When managing multiple related operations
- **Event Sourcing**: When you need complete audit trail

### For System Integration
- **Adapter**: When integrating with external systems
- **Facade**: When simplifying complex subsystems
- **Proxy**: When adding cross-cutting concerns

### For Business Logic
- **Strategy**: When algorithms vary at runtime
- **State**: When behavior depends on object state
- **Command**: When you need undo/redo functionality

### For Distributed Systems
- **Saga**: When managing distributed transactions
- **Circuit Breaker**: When handling external service failures
- **Observer**: When implementing event-driven architecture

## Implementation Guidelines

### Go-Specific Considerations
1. **Interfaces**: Use interfaces for abstraction and testability
2. **Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance
3. **Concurrency**: Leverage goroutines and channels
4. **Error Handling**: Use explicit error handling
5. **Context**: Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts

### Testing Strategies
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual pattern implementations
2. **Integration Tests**: Test pattern interactions
3. **Mock Objects**: Use mocks for dependencies
4. **Table-Driven Tests**: Use for multiple test cases

### Performance Considerations
1. **Memory Usage**: Consider memory footprint of patterns
2. **Concurrency**: Ensure thread-safe implementations
3. **Caching**: Implement caching where appropriate
4. **Lazy Loading**: Use lazy initialization when beneficial

## Common Use Cases in Fintech

### Payment Processing
- **Strategy**: Different payment methods (credit card, bank transfer, wallet)
- **Command**: Payment operations with undo capability
- **Observer**: Payment status notifications
- **Saga**: Multi-step payment processing

### Risk Management
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Risk assessment pipeline
- **Strategy**: Different risk scoring algorithms
- **State**: Risk state management
- **Circuit Breaker**: External risk service integration

### Transaction Management
- **Repository**: Transaction data access
- **Unit of Work**: Transaction batching
- **Event Sourcing**: Transaction audit trail
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write for transactions

### Notification Systems
- **Observer**: Event-driven notifications
- **Strategy**: Different notification channels
- **Template Method**: Notification formatting
- **Facade**: Simplified notification API

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Common Mistakes
1. **Over-Engineering**: Don't use patterns where simple code suffices
2. **Pattern Misuse**: Understand when NOT to use a pattern
3. **Tight Coupling**: Avoid creating dependencies between patterns
4. **Performance Issues**: Consider performance implications

### Go-Specific Anti-Patterns
1. **Interface Pollution**: Don't create interfaces for everything
2. **Goroutine Leaks**: Always clean up goroutines
3. **Panic Usage**: Avoid panics in production code
4. **Global State**: Minimize global variables

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each pattern should have one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
4. **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces are better than one general

### Documentation
1. **Clear Examples**: Provide practical, real-world examples
2. **Use Cases**: Explain when to use each pattern
3. **Trade-offs**: Document benefits and drawbacks
4. **Testing**: Include test examples

### Maintenance
1. **Version Control**: Track pattern evolution
2. **Refactoring**: Regular pattern review and improvement
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor pattern performance
4. **Code Reviews**: Include pattern usage in reviews
