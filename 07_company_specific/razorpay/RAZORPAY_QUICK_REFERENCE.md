# ‚ö° Razorpay Interview Quick Reference

> **Essential concepts and patterns for Round 2 and Round 3 interviews**

## üèóÔ∏è **System Design Quick Reference**

### **Scalability Patterns**

```
Horizontal Scaling: Add more servers
Vertical Scaling: Increase server capacity
Load Balancing: Round Robin, Weighted, Least Connections
Database Sharding: Hash-based, Range-based, Directory-based
Caching: L1 (Memory), L2 (Redis), L3 (Database)
CDN: Reduce latency, global distribution
```

### **Database Design Patterns**

```
SQL: ACID compliance, complex queries, strong consistency
NoSQL: High throughput, flexible schema, eventual consistency
Sharding: Distribute data across multiple databases
Replication: Master-slave, master-master, read replicas
Consistency: Strong, eventual, weak consistency models
```

### **Caching Strategies**

```
Cache-Aside: Application manages cache population
Write-Through: Write to cache and database simultaneously
Write-Behind: Write to cache, async to database
Refresh-Ahead: Proactive cache refresh
TTL: Time-to-live for cache expiration
```

### **Load Balancing Algorithms**

```
Round Robin: Distribute requests evenly
Weighted Round Robin: Consider server capacity
Least Connections: Route to server with fewest connections
IP Hash: Route based on client IP
Least Response Time: Route to fastest responding server
```

### **Microservices Patterns**

```
API Gateway: Single entry point, routing, authentication
Service Discovery: Eureka, Consul, etcd
Circuit Breaker: Prevent cascading failures
Bulkhead: Isolate resources
Saga Pattern: Manage distributed transactions
Event Sourcing: Store events instead of state
```

## üîß **Go Runtime Quick Reference**

### **Goroutine Management**

```
GOMAXPROCS: Number of OS threads (typically CPU cores)
Goroutine Stack: 2KB initial, grows as needed (2x factor)
Work Stealing: Efficient work distribution across processors
Context: Cancellation, timeouts, request-scoped values
Channel: Communication between goroutines
```

### **Memory Management**

```
Stack Allocation: Fast, automatic cleanup, limited size
Heap Allocation: Managed by GC, larger capacity
Escape Analysis: Compiler determines allocation location
GC Algorithm: Concurrent, tri-color mark and sweep
GC Tuning: GOGC (default 100), GOMEMLIMIT
```

### **Concurrency Patterns**

```
Worker Pool: Limit goroutine count
Pipeline: Chain of processing stages
Fan-out/Fan-in: Distribute work, collect results
Rate Limiting: Control request rate
Circuit Breaker: Prevent cascading failures
```

### **Performance Optimization**

```
Object Pooling: Reuse expensive objects
String Interning: Share common strings
Connection Pooling: Reuse database connections
Profiling: pprof for CPU, memory, goroutines
Benchmarking: Measure performance improvements
```

```

### **Memory Optimization**

```
Object Pooling: Reuse objects to reduce GC pressure
String Interning: Share common strings
