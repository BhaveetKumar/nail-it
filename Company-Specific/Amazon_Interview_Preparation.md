### **Amazon-Specific Coding Patterns**

```go
// Graph BFS - Common in Amazon interviews
func bfs(graph map[int][]int, start int) []int {
    visited := make(map[int]bool)
    queue := []int{start}
    result := []int{}

    for len(queue) > 0 {
        node := queue[0]
        queue = queue[1:]

        if visited[node] {
            continue
        }

        visited[node] = true
        result = append(result, node)

        for _, neighbor := range graph[node] {
            if !visited[neighbor] {
                queue = append(queue, neighbor)
            }
        }
    }

    return result
}

// Dynamic Programming - Knapsack problem
func knapsack(weights []int, values []int, capacity int) int {
    n := len(weights)
    dp := make([][]int, n+1)
    for i := range dp {
        dp[i] = make([]int, capacity+1)
    }

    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        for w := 1; w <= capacity; w++ {
            if weights[i-1] <= w {
                dp[i][w] = max(values[i-1]+dp[i-1][w-weights[i-1]], dp[i-1][w])
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][capacity]
}

// Sliding Window - Common pattern for arrays
func maxSubarraySum(nums []int, k int) int {
    if len(nums) < k {
        return 0
    }

    windowSum := 0
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        windowSum += nums[i]
    }

    maxSum := windowSum
    for i := k; i < len(nums); i++ {
        windowSum = windowSum - nums[i-k] + nums[i]
        maxSum = max(maxSum, windowSum)
    }

    return maxSum
}
```
