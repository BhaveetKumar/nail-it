# 02 System Design
> This section is being transitioned to a streamlined taxonomy (`frameworks/`, `patterns/`, `architecture_case_studies/`, `deep_dives/`). Legacy listing below will be progressively migrated. New content will emphasize: repeatable design process, performance & capacity reasoning, and production-ready trade-off articulation.
## New Structure (In Progress)
- `frameworks/` – Stepwise design method: clarify → constraints → capacity → architecture → trade-offs → evolution roadmap.
- `patterns/` – Resilience (circuit breaker, bulkhead), data (CQRS, event sourcing), scalability (sharding, rate limiting), multi-tenancy.
- `architecture_case_studies/` – Payment gateway, feature flag platform, streaming analytics pipeline, real-time notifications fan-out.
- `deep_dives/` – Multi-region failover, distributed transactions, consistency vs availability, performance engineering, latency budgeting.

### Migration Notes

Existing subdirectories such as `advanced/`, `case_studies/`, `patterns/` will be consolidated. Duplicated pattern files will be deduplicated with canonical versions placed under `patterns/`. Case studies retained if they add unique trade-off analysis; otherwise merged into the new architecture case studies.
### Next Steps

### Next Steps

1. Tag each legacy file with front matter (title, tags, last_updated).
2. Produce capacity planning templates in `frameworks/`.
3. Backfill missing deep dives (multi-region, latency budgets) into `deep_dives/`.
4. Archive superseded duplicates after verification.
