# 00 Foundation

High-leverage refresh: language fundamentals (advanced Node.js & Go bootstrap), core CS, essential tooling.

## Submodules

- `language_refresh/` – Accelerated Node.js deep dive + Go onboarding.
- `core_cs/` – Algorithms, data structures, networking, OS essentials (only what’s needed for senior design & perf reasoning).
- `tooling_basics/` – Git workflows, debugging, profiling primers.

## Outcome by end of Phase 1 (Week 2)

- Node.js: streaming, event loop profiling, concurrency patterns.
- Go: build, modules, interfaces, goroutines, channels (basic patterns).
- Core CS: ability to justify complexity & memory trade-offs in design sessions.
